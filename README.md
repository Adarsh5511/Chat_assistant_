# SQLite Chat Assistant
A Python-based chat assistant that interacts with an SQLite database to answer user queries. This project demonstrates how to build a simple chat interface using Flask and SQLite

# How the Assistant Works
The chat assistant is built using Flask for the backend and SQLite for the database. It accepts natural language queries from the user, converts them into SQL queries, fetches data from the database, and responds with clear, formatted answers.

# Key Features:
Natural Language Queries: Users can ask questions in plain English.
SQLite Database: Stores employee and department data.

# Dynamic Responses: The assistant responds to queries like:
"Show me all employees in the sales department."
"Who is the manager of the marketing department?"


# Technologies Used:
Python: Backend logic and SQLite interaction.
Flask: Web framework for handling HTTP requests.
SQLite: Lightweight database for storing data.
HTML/JavaScript: Frontend for user interaction.


# Steps to Run the Project Locally
Prerequisites:
Python 3.x
Flask (pip install flask)
SQLite3 (comes pre-installed with Python)

Step 1: Clone the Repository

Step 2: Set Up the Database
Run the init_db.py script to create the SQLite database and populate it with sample data.

Step 3: Run the Flask App
python chat_assistant.py

Step 4: Access the Chat Assistant
Open your browser and go to:http://127.0.0.1:5000/

Step 5: Interact with the Assistant
Type your query in the input box and press Enter or click Send.
The assistant will respond with the appropriate answer.

# Known Limitations
Limited Query Types: The assistant currently supports only a few predefined query types.
Basic NLP: The natural language processing is rudimentary and may not handle complex or ambiguous queries.
No Authentication: The app does not include user authentication or authorization.
Static Database: The database is pre-populated with static data and does not support dynamic updates.

# Suggestions for Improvement
Add More Query Types: Expand the range of supported queries (e.g., "Find employees with salaries above X").
Improve NLP: Use advanced NLP libraries like spaCy or NLTK to handle more complex queries.
Dynamic Database Updates: Allow users to add, update, or delete records in the database.
User Authentication: Add login functionality to restrict access to authorized users.
Deploy to Cloud: Host the app on a cloud platform (e.g., Heroku, Render) for public access.
Enhance UI: Improve the frontend design using frameworks like Bootstrap or React.
